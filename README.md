Presentation given for [Pittsburgh Code and Supply, April 15, 2015](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Code-Supply/events/221553015/).

### Abstract

I've been in the tech world for over twenty years now, since my first job as a software engineer in 1993. In recent years, I have come to believe that people skills as well as technical skills are necessary for all of us, especially with the increasingly fast pace in the tech world and the involvement of many stakeholders. One thing I've been working on myself, and hope to see more of in our world, is empathy.

I would like to give an overview of what empathy is, what it is not, different kinds of empathy, possible pitfalls, and concrete ways we can improve how our tech communities operate, by understanding our human nature. I will share examples of difficult scenarios I have experienced or actively participated in, where empathy could have made the situations less negative.
